# Color Odyssey Challenge

Color Odyssey Challenge(COC) is a simple game made with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), specifically [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/chrisdill/raylib-cs).

Game mechanics are based on New Your Times' [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but with here are words replaced with sequence of colors.

COC also has 2 modes:

1. Random
2. Daily

In daily mode sequence is generated based on the current date and player has only one chance at trying this sequence.

Then, player also can view his stats in both mode to compare with friends ðŸ™‚
